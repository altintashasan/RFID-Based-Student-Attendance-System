# Student Attendance System by Using RFID System 




  *☼ RFID reader is scanned the user card, then it will send the information to the microcontroller,*
  
  *☼ The data is stored in memory,*
  
  *☼ Computer receives data from microcontroller, when this operation is succesfull, the data will be compared with database.*
  
  *☼ The attendance data is saved in database.*

# Introduction
This project is created for a semester work. You can use the code to implement on your own project or standalone project work.

# Abstract
The RFID system is used to save students' attendance system. It reads the data present on the RFID tag and compares it with existing data on database. If the tag id exists and assigned with an student on the system, it will save the enterance date of the student. The system also shows the users information and access history.

Following components, languages and frameworks are used for this project.
